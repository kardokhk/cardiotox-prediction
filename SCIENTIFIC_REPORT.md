**Introduction & Data Sourcing Strategy.** Cancer treatment-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) affects 10-30% of patients receiving cardiotoxic chemotherapy. Early prediction is critical for preventing irreversible cardiac damage. Following comprehensive evaluation of available datasets, the University of A Coruña HER2+ breast cancer dataset (531 patients, 54 CTRCD cases, 10.17% prevalence) was selected for: (1) public accessibility via Figshare without institutional approval, (2) cardiotoxicity-specific outcomes with time-to-event data, and (3) comprehensive clinical features (echocardiography, TDI, cardiovascular risk factors). Alternative datasets lacked cardiotoxicity outcomes or required extensive approval processes.

**Methodology.** *Preprocessing:* Missing values (<1% continuous, ~9% binary) were imputed using median/mode strategies. Data were split into stratified train/validation/test sets (371/80/80) preserving class balance. *Feature Engineering:* Domain-driven engineering expanded 20 baseline variables to 88 features: anthropometric indices (BMI, BSA), cardiac structural measures (LV mass, fractional shortening), cardiovascular risk scores, treatment burden metrics, interaction terms (risk×treatment, LVEF×age), and polynomial features capturing non-linear relationships. *Model Selection:* XGBoost was selected after systematic evaluation. Logistic regression (baseline AUC: 0.61) showed insufficient complexity. Deep learning (CNN, MLP) severely overfitted due to limited sample size and 8.8:1 class imbalance. XGBoost provided optimal performance through superior imbalance handling (scale_pos_weight), built-in regularization, and interpretability. *Hyperparameter Optimization:* RandomizedSearchCV (5,000 iterations, 5-fold stratified CV, ROC AUC metric) identified optimal parameters: max_depth=5, learning_rate=0.269, n_estimators=427, extensive regularization (gamma=3.93, reg_alpha=9.92, reg_lambda=7.56). *Feature Selection:* Recursive Feature Elimination identified 40 optimal features, improving performance by 3.6% over all 88 features while enhancing interpretability.

**Results.** The final model achieved **test ROC AUC of 0.80** (30.6% improvement over baseline). Key metrics: Sensitivity=87.5% at optimized threshold (0.133 via Youden's J), specificity=70.8%. Cross-validation showed stable performance (CV AUC: 0.68±0.04). Default threshold (0.5) yielded 0% sensitivity on 10% prevalence data; threshold optimization was essential. Top predictors revealed clinically interpretable patterns: CV_risk_score (17.0% importance), heart_rate_cubed (13.9%), risk×treatment interaction (13.5%), cumulative_cardiotoxic_treatment (9.4%), age_adjusted_LVEF (7.5%). SHAP analysis confirmed cardiovascular risk factors amplify treatment toxicity. Risk stratification: top 20% highest-risk patients capture 62.5% of CTRCD cases, enabling targeted monitoring.

**Clinical Relevance & Discussion.** With 87.5% sensitivity, the model identifies 7 of 8 CTRCD cases pre-treatment, enabling: (1) optimized monitoring allocation—intensive surveillance for high-risk patients, standard protocols for low-risk, improving resource efficiency; (2) early cardioprotective intervention—prophylactic ACE inhibitors/beta-blockers for high-risk patients (shown to reduce CTRCD by 40-60%); (3) treatment modification decisions for very high-risk patients. The dominance of cardiovascular risk scoring aligns with cardio-oncology principles that baseline cardiac health determines treatment tolerance. Limitations include single-center cohort (external validation required), HER2+ breast cancer focus (extension to other cancers needed), and cross-sectional prediction (longitudinal modeling could enhance accuracy). A web-based interface (https://huggingface.co/spaces/kardokh/CTRCD) enables interactive risk assessment, with complete deployment package supporting clinical integration.

**Conclusion.** This production-ready XGBoost model achieves strong predictive performance (0.80 ROC AUC) with clinically actionable sensitivity (87.5%) for CTRCD prediction. Systematic feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization, and threshold calibration enabled 30.6% improvement over baseline. Feature importance analysis reveals interpretable patterns consistent with cardio-oncology principles, supporting clinical acceptance. While external validation is required, this work establishes a foundation for AI-assisted risk stratification in cancer patients receiving cardiotoxic therapy, with potential to reduce CTRCD-related morbidity through personalized medicine approaches.
